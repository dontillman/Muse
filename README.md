JavaScript simulation of the Triadex Muse

The Muse was a digital algorithmic music composing machine invented in 1969 by Marvin Minsky and Edward Fredkin at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  It was built with the digital logic circuitry of the day; gates, registers, and counters in simple integrated circuits.

It's a fascinating device, and since there were only a small number built, and a tiny few actually operational 40-something years later, I built a JavaScript simluation along with an extensive writeup.

The Barbican Centre in London put together an exhibit called "AI: More Than Human", and included this simulation running on a tablet next to a physical Muse.  


This is the code for the Muse simulation.  It's all artisanal JavaScript.

*article* is the original version for the article.

*barbican* is the version I did for the Barbican Center.  It features some skeuomorphism and prints the score in music notation.

*multi* is an experiment with multiple Muses playing together.  The approach I used didn't turn out as well as I'd like.  Someday I will redo this.
